How To Use:
When running the CritterWorld Simulator via Main.java, the console is used as LOGGING ONLY.

1. One UI window will pop up with a text field, enter the bounds for the grid, the grid is square
2. Once the 'Set' button is pressed another window will pop up with an inital setup of the CirtterWorld

The 'Increment' button can be used to increment the worlds time by the number of steps specified in the adjacent text field

The 'Reset' button will reset the world to a new, random initial state

The 'Spawn' button is to be used in conjection with the adjacent ComboBox (drop-down menue) which can select a type of Critter to spawn in the world

The world can always be redrawn and re-initialised with different bounds by used the inital window, changing the bounds, and pressing the 'Set' button

To exit the simulation, hit the X or EXIT button in bot windows' top right corners (for mac, may be a red dot)

Future Functionality will include:
	- Stats windows for the Critter population DONE
	- Individual stats for each Critter present in the world
	- Dynamic resizing of the windows based on the bounds (up to a max. and min. limit) to preserve redability

Optional Future Funtionality:
	- Previous/Next State functions to show one time step differences in the world
	- Custom Critter spawning
	- Custom Critter builder
